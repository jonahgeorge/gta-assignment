\subsection{Proposed Solution}

Our proposed solution is to build a web service that will automate the assignment of GTAs to classes. 
Our program will take in many factors such as: student experience, student preferences, teachers preferences, and required skills. 
Our program will also fetch class statistics for all of the classes offered at Oregon State University. 
This means we will always have up-to-date information on class metadata, such as enrollment, capacity, and location. 
Our system relies on students and teachers inputting a variety of information which will help with selecting the right GTA for the right class.
