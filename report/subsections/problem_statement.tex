\subsection{Problem Statement}

GTA Corvallis is a project sponsored by Prasad Tadepalli of the OSU Computer Science department. Currently, Professor Tadepalli is responsible for hand-assigning graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) to classes at the beginning of each term. This takes an unreasonable amount of time and can be very frustrating when dealing with the requests of numerous instructors and students.
