<h2>Section Preferences</h2>

<p>
  By marking sections as favorable or disfavorable, you can impact the
  likelihood of being assinged to those sections. This are not necessary, but
  we recommend setting them if you know which sections you prefer.

<% if @section_preferences.empty? %>
  <div class="well">No section preferences found.</div>
<% else %>
  <div class="list-group">
    <%= render @section_preferences %>
  </div>
<% end %>

<%= link_to "Add a section preference", new_section_preference_path, class: "btn btn-default" %>
